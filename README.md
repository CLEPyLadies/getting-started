Basic Python installation instructions and tips

## Installing Python

Install most recent stable version of Python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

If you do not already have a favorite text editor or IDE, install the community version of [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/).

From the command line, test if you have python properly installed.
- `python --version` or
- `python3 --version`

Then ensure you have pip
- `pip show pip` or
- `pip3 show pip`

You use pip by typing
`python -m pip install <<package-name>>`

Be careful of typos during pip install, as that is one way hackers try to use pip to gain access to your machine.
